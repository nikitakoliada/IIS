    <h2>Welcome to the School Equipment Rental Management System</h2>
    <p>
        This system is designed to manage the lending of technical tools and equipment across multiple studios. Each
        studio owns specific equipment, and each piece of equipment has unique attributes such as the year of
        manufacture, purchase date, and an image.
    </p>
    <p>
        The owner of the equipment sets the maximum rental duration for each item. Information regarding where and
        when equipment can be picked up must also be provided. The system organizes equipment into categories (e.g.,
        computer equipment, cameras, microphones, etc.). These categories are shared among all studios, but only the
        studio that owns the equipment can manage it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both students and instructors assigned to a specific studio can reserve and borrow equipment. Additionally,
        the studio manager can restrict the borrowing of certain equipment to specific users within their studio.
    </p>
